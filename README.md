# MApping the PTA sky (MAPS)

A Python package by Nihan Pol, MAPS aims to simplify the task of searching for anisotropies in the nanohertz gravitational wave sky observed with PTAs. 

## Installation

As of now, the only way to install MAPS is to clone the directory yourself, then when inside the maps directory use the command:

```pip install .```

This has had the fewest problems and is likely the easiest way to get MAPS working.


## Usage

While there are a few examples for using MAPS found in the maps/docs folder, anis_pta.py has been overhauled to be more explicit in its documentation. If you are using VSCode or Jupyter notebooks, the doc comments should appear when attempting to use a command. If things are not clear, that likely isn't your fault, and raising a github issue with the problem will bring our attention to it and fix it!
